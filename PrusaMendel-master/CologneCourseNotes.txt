M8 nut trap on the wade big gear is toooooo big
-> caused by the M8 nut set toooo big because of the compatibility with 5/16
--> but the wade bolts are all M8 so I need to introduce new variable in the settings

M3 nut traps in gregstruder are tooo small
-> introduce the M3 nut size for not melting in
